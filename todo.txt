1 - Task Representation:
  You have the basic properties (title, description, dueDate, priority) in your factory function. Are there any additional properties you want to include for each to-do item?

2 - User Interface (UI):
  How do you plan to interact with your to-do list? Will you have a web interface? If so, think about the structure and layout of your UI.

3 - Adding To-Dos:
  Consider how you'll allow users to add new to-dos. Will there be a form? What data validation or user feedback do you want to include?

4 - Displaying To-Dos:
  How will you display the list of to-dos? Will you have a separate view for completed and pending tasks?

5 - Updating To-Dos:
  Think about how users will update existing to-dos. Will they be able to edit the title, description, due date, or priority?

6 -Removing To-Dos:
  How will users delete to-dos they no longer need?

7 - Persistence:
  Do you want to store the to-dos locally (e.g., using browser storage) or on a server? This will affect how to-dos are saved between sessions.

8 - User Feedback:
  Consider providing feedback to users for successful operations or error handling.

9 -Testing:
  Plan how you'll test your application. This could include unit tests for your functions and integration tests for the overall functionality.

10 - Scalability:
  If your to-do list grows in complexity, consider how well your current design will scale. Are there any design patterns or architectural decisions you want to implement for future expansion?
